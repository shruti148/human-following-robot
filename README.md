Human Following Robot is an end-to-end Arduino-based prototype that autonomously tracks and follows a person. It features modular C++ navigation & perception, Python missionâ€‘ops tooling, and comprehensive test suites.

Overview

Sensor Fusion & Perception: IR + ultrasonic sensors (with PixyCam stubs)

Navigation & Control: PID-based motion control for smooth tracking

Mission Operations: State machine (IDLE, FOLLOW, AVOID, STOP)

Testing & Debugging:

C++ unit tests (GoogleTest)

Python integration tests (pytest)

Simulation & Analytics: Python scripts for mission simulation and data visualization

Collaboration: CONTRIBUTING guidelines, code reviews, clear documentation

Designed to mirror real-world workflows in both field and space robotics.
